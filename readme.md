Final Version
What's new :
1. Database change
2. UI improvement (imo)
3. Customer data feature added
4. Validation in transaction feature added
5. Customer data in transaction feature added
6. Some bug fixes

What's Missing/Not So Great Stuff
1. Some UI elements are still inconsistent on different screen resolutions
2. UI still looks kinda plain, though I think it’s an improvement from before (maybe?)
3. Minor bug: if you add items before entering customer data and processing the payment (with the correct payment amount, of course), an error warning will pop up when you click "Pay" — just hit OK and re-enter the payment amount, and you're good to go

Feel free to use this code :)
But i'm not guarateed this is gonna work for you
If you encountered a bug or error
Fix it yourself :p
